resources:
  # ConfigMaps specific to Genesis (that are NOT in common/kustomization.yaml)
  - config.yaml
  - genesis-overrides-configmap.yaml
  # The 'node-config-configmap.yaml' for genesis is now included via the ../common base

  # Workloads specific to Genesis
  - node-statefulset.yaml
  - api-deployment.yaml

# Note: Patches for genesis-specific overrides (e.g., different image tags
# or resource limits than a common base, if you had one for workloads)
# would go here.
